# The Glossary

<Box>
This is a glossary of terms commonly used in the Kristal sphere.
</Box>

## General Programming

Kristal assumes that you are familiar with basic programming concepts. But if not, this is a list of some common terms you might see.

---

### Terminal

A terminal is an input for text commands. Also known as a "command line" or "console".

On Windows, you've most likely used "Command Prompt" or "PowerShell" before. Those both run inside of your "terminal".

- **Windows 11**: You should have "Windows Terminal" by default. Please use that.
- **Windows 10 and below**: You can open "Command Prompt", which should open your console. <small>(If you want something better for Windows 10, you can also install Windows Terminal, however it is not default.)</small>
- **Linux**: This depends on your distro, but you should be very familiar with your terminal anyways if you're using Linux.
- **macOS**: You can find "Terminal" in your Applications > Utilities folder.

<small>This is a huge oversimplification, tailored to our own purposes.
In reality, you have "Terminal Emulators" and "Shells", but that does not matter much for Kristal.
In the cases it DOES matter, you most likely know the difference anyways.</small>

### Environment variables

AKA "`env` vars", are variables whose values can be read from anywhere.

[See](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable)

### Repository

Most of the time, we're referring to a "Git repository", which is a way for developers to manage and share their code.
The "Kristal repository" refers to where the source code of Kristal lives.

We do not have a Git tutorial (at the moment), but most of the time you should be making one for every mod.

**Do not use file-sharing services like Google Drive or Dropbox to work with someone. They are not meant for code.**

## Kristal-Specific Terms

Kristal has some terms that are specific to it. While not all of them are explained here, some common ones are.

---

### Mod

Kristal is a "game engine". It is a program with the purpose of letting you make your own games.

A "mod" is a game/project made with Kristal. **These are NOT mods of DELTARUNE, and should NOT be referred to as such.** Most of the time, they are *fangames*.

They are only called "mods" for legacy reasons. Once again, they are NOT mods of DELTARUNE. You are NOT modifying DELTARUNE in any way.

---

### Libraries

Libraries are "sub-mods" of your mod. They implement functionality that you can use in your mod.
See the [Using Libraries page](/wiki/using-libraries) for more information.

---

### Shadow

"Shadow" is the name of our website (the one that you're on right now).
Most people call it the "Kristal Wiki" as that's its most prominent page, but it does contain more than just the wiki.

---

### LÖVE

Kristal is built on top of [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/), a framework for making 2D games in Lua.
